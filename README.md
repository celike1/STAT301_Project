# STAT 301 Project

## Group Interview Progress
### Current Progress:
- Chosen our dataset and conducted collective wrangling + EDA
- Using the data we could find correlations between the features and produce linear models.
- Each group member created different plot to explore the data (histogram, scatter, boxplot, etc.)
### Next Steps:
- Agree on time to meetup to discuss Assignment 3
- Finalize question and combine agreed parts of EDA (as they were done separately)
- Agree on a specific method to investigate question (SLR, MLR, etc.)
- Brainstorm visualizations we would like to make with the method

### Possible TA Questions:
1. ???
